    "In this section the crawler for the Sina Weibo social media platform will be described.\n",

    "The platform is most prominently used in China, therefore the searched keywords are in Chinese too. With only a Dutch phone number it is impossible to create a new account on Sina Weibo, which already prevents the usage of the API provided by Sina Weibo itself. Also if the website is accessed without an account the user will automatically be redirected to the front page. The only exception is the access through the mobile version of the website: https://m.weibo.cn. This version of the website has no restrictions regarding accounts or geolocation, and can therefore be used as a basis for the crawler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through research an already existing crawler was found: https://github.com/KaidiGuo/keyword_based_Sina_weibo_crawler. This crawler however was not maintained for several years and not functional anymore. It still gave insight in how to construct a working crawler for Sina Weibo using the mobile website. More specifically, this crawler accesses the API that is used as a data model for the mobile version of the platform: https://m.weibo.cn/api/.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the functionality of the crawler several utility functions are necessary, which will be explained first.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the crawled data reusable at a later point in time it was decided that the results of the crawl should be persisted in a file, so that it could be used later on. For this it needs to be checked if a fitting directory already exists, or if it has to be created. The function for this is depicted below. It checks if a folder called \"data\" exists within the location in which this notebook will be executed, and creates such a directory if it does not exist yet."

    "The Sina Weibo mobile API returns posts in form of so-called cards. They are however not returned as a list but a tree with any number of branches on each node. To make them easier processable later on a function is provided that puts the cards into a list. There are also many cards that contain no actual posts but e.g. suggestions for users that might be interesting to the user, advertisements, etc., which are not relevant for this research and are therefore filtered from the list too.\n",

    "* left_- and right_element: Some cards are split horizontally and contain two \"mblog\" cards that can be added to the list\n",

The cards 0 and 1 contain a card with a singular \"mblog\", which can be added to the list. Card 2 contains a \"card_group\", which in turn contains a card with a \"mblog\" and a card without a group or a post. Therefore only the first child of card 2 should be added to the list.\n",
